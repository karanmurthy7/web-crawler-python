A Web crawler, sometimes called a spider, is an Internet bot that systematically browses the World Wide Web, typically for the purpose of Web indexing (web spidering).

This repository consists of a web-crawler written using the Beautiful Soup Library in Python. 
The web-crawler scrapes data from a single page and saves the details in a SQLite database.
